My HTML Resume

## Why HTML?
I believe HTML is _the best medium_ for communication currently available to humans. It's open source, is capabile of extreme precision, and allows for communicating through nearly any visual and audal medium. It's also potentially the most accessible medium across any device, allowing for assistive tools, and easily crawled by tools that translate it into different languages. When written semantically, it even does an amazing job at communicating intentions.

## Why Git?
Transparency is one of my core values, so I offer visibility to my resume's version history to anyone who has the time and interest to look at it.
